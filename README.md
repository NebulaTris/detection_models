## Introduction

Emotion detection in facial expressions is a fascinating field with numerous applications, including human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and mental health monitoring. In this repository, we provide multiple facial emotion detection models, each with its own unique approach to this exciting problem.

## Models

### User Database Model

The User Database Model leverages a user-specific database of facial expressions to detect emotions. It is designed for scenarios where the system can adapt to individual users' facial expressions and emotional cues over time.

### FER2013 Model

The FER2013 Model utilizes the widely used FER2013 dataset, which contains a vast collection of labeled facial expressions. This model is suitable for generic emotion detection tasks and can be applied to various contexts.

## Dataset

We have included the FER2013 dataset in this repository, which you can use to train and evaluate the FER2013 Model. You can find the dataset in the fer2013_model directory.

## Use of Models

We have used the face emotion detection models in a projects, including a face emotion based music recommender which is available at ``emotion-based-music-recommender-resnet50v2.ipynb``

## Usage

To use any of the provided models or datasets, please refer to the specific README files within their respective directories for detailed instructions on training, evaluation, and integration.
