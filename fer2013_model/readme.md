# Face Emotion Detection Model - FER 2013

Welcome to the Face Detection Model based on the FER 2013 dataset! This subdirectory contains the necessary resources to train and test a face detection model using the FER 2013 dataset.

## Contents

1. **Train Folder**: Contains the training dataset used to train the face detection model. This dataset is sourced from the FER 2013 dataset, which includes labeled facial expressions images.

2. **Test Folder**: Holds the testing dataset to evaluate the performance of the trained face detection model. It ensures the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.

3. **facedetection.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the source code for training and testing the face detection model. This notebook provides a step-by-step guide and explanation of the model implementation.

## Instructions

1. **Train the Model**: Utilize the images in the "Train" folder to train the face detection model. Adjust hyperparameters and network architecture as needed.

2. **Test the Model**: Evaluate the trained model using the images in the "Test" folder. Analyze its accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

3. **facedetection.ipynb**: Refer to this Jupyter Notebook for detailed source code and explanations. Execute cells sequentially for a clear understanding of the model implementation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NebulaTris/detection_models.git
   cd detection_models/fer2013_model
   ```

2. Open and run the `facedetection.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook for training and testing the face detection model.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and enhance the face detection model. Happy coding! ðŸš€
